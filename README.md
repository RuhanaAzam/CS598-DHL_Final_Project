# Reproducibility of Harmonized Representation Learning on Dynamic EHR (HORDE)

This following is the code and instructions necessary for my attempt to reproduce the results from ["Harmonized representation learning on dynamic EHR graphs"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S153204642030054X) [1]. The oringal repo for the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/donalee/HORDE).
